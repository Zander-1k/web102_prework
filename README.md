## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Building this app was a great learning experience in Git and JavaScript. The main challenges were setting up my Git identity to push code and managing the different branches (main vs. master) to make my work visible on GitHub. I also learned to use array destructuring to calculate the project's secret key and fixed image file paths so the game cards displayed correctly on the live site.
